## Sentiment Analysis

To gage the overall tone of a body of text, we classify the utilization of various words to score the sentence by its overall tone. Specific words can add a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment to the sentence. The overall sentiment is then derived from a factor of these three: if the sentence is overwhelmingly neutral, with very little positive or negative content, the resulting score will be near 0, while positive sentences will be closer to 1 and negative sentences closer to -1.
